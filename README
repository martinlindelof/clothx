# clothx is a traer physics port
# I keep the large version number the same,
# but the 2nd float is my port version number
# since i target more than java, but flash , c++ and js
# I need to add stuff

# have fun! 

# let me and traer.cc/physics Jeff know what you do with 
# this lib

# look for forks, I never got around to make the C++ target
# and I rarely use haxe, I've moved on to C++ instead.
